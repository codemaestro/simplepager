This project includes Daniel Drayne's original quickPager plugin
to show the lightweight and versatile system he built
for jQuery 1.3.1.

Three years later, I found the quickPager plugin for a recent
project. As usual, the client's needs became increasingly more
complex, so I added extra features, to the point where the plugin
no longer qualifies as "lightweight". (Sorry Dan!)

View the demos for usage descriptions and sample code.

Enjoy!
